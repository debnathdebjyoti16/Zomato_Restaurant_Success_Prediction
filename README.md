### In this project we will learn how to predict the success of a Zomato restaurent using Machine Learning

1. **First we will understand the data**
2. **Then we will learn how to extract the data from Sqlite database**
3. **Then we will perform Data cleaning on our data**
4. **Perform Wordcloud Analysis**
5. **Handle the missing values**
6. **Then we will learn how to perform feature extration**
7. **After that we will learn how to handle the outliers**
8. **Once all these are done, we will learn how to build a Machine Learning Model**
9. **Validating our model**
10. **Optimizing our model**
11. **Finally predict the success of the restaurent**
